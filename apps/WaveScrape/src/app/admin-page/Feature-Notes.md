# Admin Page â€” Feature Notes

I want to add breaks, regions to my app. (These are things that don't change). 
I want to add them to my production database, but I don't want to change the database *directly*.   
__Admin Page feature__ is a way to quality control adding and modifying that data that passes through the production data base.
