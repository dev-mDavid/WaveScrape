# Problem Types

## General Advice
1. Take time to understand the problem
1. Look for the root cause
1. Let Problem rest in the subconscious
1. Document recipes and resources to solve similar problems

+ __Identify__ — 
understand the nature of the problem  
  + __context__ — *what* is it in layman terms?
  + __issue__ — *why* is this a problem?
  + __care__ —  *why* do I care?

+ __Research & Refine__ —  
google and see how others sovled this problem  
(also make sure you understand how the code works before using it)
  + __research__ —
    + similar problem
    + similar code
  + __refine__ —
    + break down promblem into smaller problems  
    *(and repeat research)*
    + if more than one solution,   
    consider pros & cons (trade-offs)  
    think about scalability and update-ablity 

  + __talk about it__ —  
    + talk about it with other developers
    + talk about it aloud is if teaching someone ⁺
+ __Pseudocode__ —  
outline for how we'll implement our code
  + goal — focus on __logic__, *not* syntax
  + tools —  whiteboard, paper, used language

+ __Test__ — helps understand your code and prevent regression [on updating]
  + aka Test Driven Development (TDD)
  + optional, but highly recommended
  + skill of experienced developer — understand what test will be valuable for that feature
  + write the test before you write your code
  + red, green, refactor process —
    1. failing test (red)
    2. write code that passes (green)
    3. optimize it (refactor)
    
+ __Implement__ —  
  + hackathon — try to get it done as quickly as possible
    + have all my test passing,  
    prototype working  
    __all__ in the *least* amount of time possible
    + even if the code isn't perfect (red → green)  
    "Done is better than perfect"
      + Sovling a problem is a bunch of small steps  
      and if you try to perfect each small step,  
      it takes a long time to get to the finish line
      + once you get to a working prototype,   
      you have the confidence that this problem can be solved      
+ __Reflect__ —  
  + when you find yourself __banging your head__ against a wall,   
  take a 15–min break
  + you might find yourself solving the problem within 5–min,  
  your subconscious mind is still working on the problem

+ __Improve__ — it's easier to improve a working piece of code,  
  than it is to write a perfect piece of code on the first go-around   
  + improve readability
  + add comments
  + remove duplication
  + optimize space time / complexity
  + add caching to improve cloud computing costs
  + add error handling  
+ __Repeat  & Practice__ — 
  + Practice and repeat until it becomes intuitive
  + Form to leave form
